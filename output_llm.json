These measures are likely to drive inflation in the United States and disrupt global trade flows. While India is relatively better positioned than many other countries, which may face steeper tariffs, its exports to the US are still expected to come under pressure due to a slowdown in the US economy. However, merchandise exports to the US amount to only 2% of GDP, which limits the impact of tariffs. With significant uncertainty surrounding the implementation of tariffs and their potential impact on global trade, the equity risk premium has the potential to rise across markets. Hence, investors should prepare for further volatility."

We think market has already priced in two rate cuts both in bonds and OIS markets, also spreads compressed between the G-sec and corporate bonds as investors subscribed for better accrual specially in the short-medium term yield curve i.e. 2–5-year maturity. The narrowing spread between the US treasury and India’s G-secs (at 165 bps it has narrowed by roughly three-quarters) may act as a deterrent for the yields to soften further significantly further add complexity of Japan rising yield and inflation. It is important to disentangle whether the narrowing gap is primarily due to India’s improving macroeconomic fundamentals or external developments like US monetary policy shifts.
